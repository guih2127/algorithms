// Good code?

// 1 - Readable -> Code that is good to read for other people as well.
// 2 - Scalable -> Speed -> How many time our function takes to execute? How many operations it executes? -> TIME COMPLEXITY
// 3 - Scalable -> Memory -> If our code uses too much memory, this can be bad. We have limited memory. -> SPACE COMPLEXITY

// Heap and Stack
// Heap -> We store variables
// Stack -> We keep track of our function calls
